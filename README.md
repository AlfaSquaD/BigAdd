# Lexical Analyzer for BigAdd Language

## Big Add language

BigAdd language is a small programming language that has been designed in order to add and subtract
big integers programmatically and display the result on the screen.

BigAdd is an interpreted language. The BigAdd interpreter works from the command line with the command BA, and takes the script
fileâ€™s name as the only attribute.

example: The command `c:\> ba myscript.ba`
must load and execute the script file called myscript.ba

## How to use Lexical Analyzer for BigAdd Language
To analyze a file, you should use the following format

- `la <PATH>`

The path is the path of the file which you want to analyze.

The analyzer will print its working path to help you.

Note: You should include the file extension

### Example command

- `la ./script.ba`

## Lexical analyzers' data structures

### KeyWord

#### KeyWord Struct

```c
typedef struct keyWordStruct {
    char *keyWord; // Keyword
    char expectedKeycode; // Expected keycode after this keyword
    char keycode; // Its' code.
    unsigned char flagsForKeyword; // Expected flag for the use of this keyWord
    unsigned char flagsForNextWord; // Flag for next expected "word". (It could be anything (Identifier, String, Int, ...))
    struct keyWordStruct *next; // next Keyword
} KeyWord;
```

Keeps all keywords in a linked list.

#### All Flags

Flag               | Binary Value | Decimal Value | Description
---------------    | ------------ | ------------- | -----------
LINE_ENDED         | 0b00000001   | 1             | Indicates current is line ended
STRING_EXPECTED    | 0b00000010   | 2             | A String Constant is expected
INT_EXPECTED       | 0b00000100   | 4             | A Int Constant is expected
IDENTIFIER_USE     | 0b00001000   | 8             | A declared identifier is expected
IDENTIFIER_DECLARE | 0b00100000   | 32            | A not declared identifier is expected
BLOCK_EXPECTED     | 0b01000001   | 65            | A Openblock or start of a new line is expected
NOP                | 0b10000000   | 128           | If flag set to NOP lexical analyzer expecting `expectedKeycode`
IDENTIFIER_EXPECTED| 0b00101000   | 40            | Declared or not declared identifier is expected
KEYWORD_EXPECTED   | 0b11000001   | 193           | A keyword is expected
INT_VAL            | 0b00001100   | 12            | Int Constant or declared identifier is expected
OUT_LIST           | 0b00001110   | 14            | A String Constant, Int Constant or declared Identifier is expected

Lexical analyzer checks flag status with "Bitwise And" or "=="

After a non-keyword word, the lexical analyzer sets the flag to NOP

#### All Keywords
KeyCode | Keyword | Expected Keycode | Expected keyword | Expected Flag      | Next Flag
------- | ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------
0       | int     | 11               | .                | LINE_ENDED         | IDENTIFIER_DECLARE

13      | from    | 11               | .                | NOP                | IDENTIFIER_USE

* KeyCode: Keywords' code.
* Keyword: Keyword itself.
* Expected KeyCode: Next expected keycode.
* Expected Keyword: Next expected keyword.
* Expected Flag: Expected flag for the use of this KeyWord.
* Next Flag: Flag for next expected "word".

Lexical analyzer always checks flag first.

If `(flag & KEYWORD_EXPECTED)` bitwise operation is `0`,
lexical analyzer expects a non-keyword word.

Otherwise, the lexical analyzer expects a keyword according to the expectedKeycode.

Note: If the Expected keycode is -1, the lexical analyzer expects the flag to be LINE_ENDED.
Otherwise, the lexical analyzer expects the flag to be NOP.

#### Keyword Functions

* ```c 
  KeyWord *addKeyWord(char *keyWord, KeyWord *prev, char keycode, char expectedKeyCode, unsigned char flagsForKeyWord,
                    unsigned char flagsForNextKeyWord);

* ```c 
  BlockKeeper *createBlockKeeper()
  ```
  * Creates a BlockKeeper and returns its pointer.

* ```c 
  void freeBlockKeeper(BlockKeeper *blockKeeper)
  ```
  * Frees given BlockKeeper.


## Lexical Analyzer Helper Functions
Lexical Analyzer has two header files. These are `fileio.h` and `errhandle.h`
* `fileio.h` -> Functions about file operations
* `errhandle.h` -> Functions about error handling

### fileio.h

* ```c 
  FILE *openFile(char *path, char *mode);
  ```
  * Opens file at the given path. If it fails, print an error message.

* ```c 
  void strclr(char *str, const int BUFFER_SIZE);
  ```
  * Clears given String(char array). BUFFER_SIZE is the size of the char array.

* ```c 
  bool skipIgnoreChars(FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker);
  ```
  * Skips all unimportant characters in given file. Unimportant characters are:
    * White Space (' ')
    * Line break ('\n')
    * Carriage return ('\r')
    * Tab character ('\t'')
  * Returns true if a character is skipped.

* ```c 
  bool skipCommentBlocks(FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker);
  ```
  * Skips Comment blocks. Returns true if a comment block is skipped

* ```c 
  void seekEOL(FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker);
  ```
  * Seeks to End of Line('.')

* ```c 
  void getWord(char *out, FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker, const int BUFFER_SIZE);
  ```
  * Gets a word in file and writes it to out.
  * There are exceptions at reading. Exceptions are:
    * If first character read is,
      * End Of Line ('.')
      * Separator (',')
      * Open or Close Block ('\[' / '\]')

      only write read character and return.
    * If the first character read is Lexeme String (' \" '), Reads until another Lexeme String. If can't find another Lexeme String, returns.

    * Otherwise, reads until the end of word. (Word termination characters are one of above and White space)

### errhandle.h

* ```c 
  void resetToEOL(char *word, unsigned char *flag, char *expectedKeycode, FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker);
  ```
  * Resets lexical analyzer. After an error, the lexical analyzer stops reading and resets itself to a new line
    (After '.' character)


* ```c 
  void err(char *word, KeyWord *root, char *expectedKeycode, unsigned char *flag, FILE *fPtr, LineTracker *tracker);
  ```
  * This function handles all errors.
  * Prints Expected word, read word, line information about the error.
  * Resets lexical analyzer

* ```c 
  void checkBlocks(BlockKeeper *blockKeeper);
  ```
  * Checks for blocks which is/are left open.
  * If there is one, Prints information about left open block/s

## Main program loop
1. Initialize all necessary structs and variables
2. While loop:
  1. If we reach the end of the file, exit the loop
  2. Get word using `getWord` function
  3. Check if the word is empty `strcmp(currWord, "")`
  4. Check if the word is a keyword
  5. If flag and word do not match, give error and seek to end of line
  6. Else write analysis results to write the file.
  7. If the word is a keyword, set flag and expectedKeycode. Otherwise, set flag to NOP

3. Check if any of the block/s are left open
4. Check if the flag is LINE_ENDED
5. Free all allocated memory
